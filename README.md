# ProgrammerPuzzle

Programmer Puzzle is an Android application, in which the user can play 41 different puzzles 
in 3 different languages (C++, Java, Python). The goal is to reverse engineer a source code 
that has been broken up to pieces, in a way that solves the given problem.

throughout testing of the application I used Espresso API for automated testing.
